## About

This project is the web implementation of a Figma design, translated directly into HTML for structure and CSS for styling, and some JavaScript for functionality. The goal was to faithfully recreate the visual aesthetics and responsiveness outlined in the design, providing a clean and intuitive user interface for the site.

## Figma Design

The website's visual design was provided as a Figma file, which served as the blueprint for this implementation.
