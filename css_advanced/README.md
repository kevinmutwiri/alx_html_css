# SmileSchool

## About

This project is the web implementation of a Figma design, translated directly into HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The goal was to faithfully recreate the visual aesthetics and responsiveness outlined in the design, providing a clean and intuitive user interface for SmileSchool

## Figma Design

The website's visual design was provided as a Figma file, which served as the blueprint for this implementation.
